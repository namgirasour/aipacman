PacMan Machine Learning AI Project:

Basic Search implements tree-structure search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and the like.

Multiagent Search employs tree-structure search methods tailored for multiplayer games like PacMan

Reinforcement Learning utilizes foundational machine learning techniques, including value iteration, Q-learning, and reinforcement learning itself. These strategies offer a broader perspective on playing PacMan by leveraging extracted features and continually adjusting weights through training.
